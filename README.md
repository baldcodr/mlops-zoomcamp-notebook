## Overview
ML model optimization requires running several experiments in order to get the parameters that give the best output for our model.
Tracking and managing these experiments manually is a daunting task and requires the use of appropriate to automate these processes.

### Objective
Learning the practical aspects of productionizing ML services â€” from collecting requirements to model deployment, monitoring and model management.
